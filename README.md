# Writer's Blocks

## A WordPress theme for writers' portfolios.

### Background

This theme was initially developed for [Lauren Orsini](http://laurenraeorsini.com/).

### Dependencies and requirements

This theme is a child theme of the [HTML5 Boilerplate Theme](https://github.com/zencoder/html5-boilerplate-for-wordpress).

This theme also uses [Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress](http://github.com/jaredatch/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress), but those elements are included in the repo.

This theme uses Sass; /scss/style.scss should be pointed to /css/style.css using whatever flavor of Sassy CSS you prefer.
